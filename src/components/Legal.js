      <h5>9. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h5>
      <ul>
        Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile
        applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can
        activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your
        online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage no
        uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals
        has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser
        signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your
        choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is
        adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that
        practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.

        Informal Negotiations
        <ul>
          To expedite resolution and control the cost of any dispute,
          controversy, or claim related to these Terms of Use (each "Dispute"
          and collectively, the “Disputes”) brought by either you or us
          (individually, a “Party” and collectively, the “Parties”), the Parties
          agree to first attempt to negotiate any Dispute (except those Disputes
          expressly provided below) informally for at least __________ days
          before initiating arbitration. Such informal negotiations commence
          upon written notice from one Party to the other Party.
        </ul>
        Binding Arbitration
        <ul>
          Any dispute arising out of or in connection with this contract,
          including any question regarding its existence, validity, or
          termination, shall be referred to and finally resolved by the
          International Commercial Arbitration Court under the European
          Arbitration Chamber (Belgium, Brussels, Avenue Louise, 146) according
          to the Rules of this ICAC, which, as a result of referring to it, is
          considered as the part of this clause. The number of arbitrators shall
          be __________. The seat, or legal place, of arbitration shall be
          __________. The language to be used in the arbitral proceedings shall
          be __________. The governing law of the contract shall be the

        </ul>
        Restrictions
        <ul>
          The Parties agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Dispute
          between the Parties individually. To the full extent permitted by law,
          (a) no arbitration shall be joined with any other proceeding; (b)
          there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a
          class-action basis or to utilize class action procedures; and (c)
          there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a
          purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public or
          any other persons.
        </ul>
        Exceptions to Informal Negotiations and Arbitration
        <ul>
          The Parties agree that the following Disputes are not subject to the
          above provisions concerning informal negotiations and binding
          arbitration: (a) any Disputes seeking to enforce or protect, or
          concerning the validity of, any of the intellectual property rights of
          a Party; (b) any Dispute related to, or arising from, allegations of
          theft, piracy, invasion of privacy, or unauthorized use; and (c) any
          claim for injunctive relief. If this provision is found to be illegal
          or unenforceable, then neither Party will elect to arbitrate any
          Dispute falling within that portion of this provision found to be
          illegal or unenforceable and such Dispute shall be decided by a court
          of competent jurisdiction within the courts listed for jurisdiction
          above, and the Parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of
          that court.
